<h1>HCHO Analysis in Sri Lanka</h1>

Introduction
This coursework focuses on the analysis of formaldehyde (HCHO) levels in Sri Lanka, utilizing data collected from the Sentinel-5P satellite. HCHO is a harmful air pollutant associated with various health issues, including respiratory irritation and cancer risks. Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of HCHO is essential for assessing air quality, identifying emission sources, and monitoring the effectiveness of air quality regulations.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this coursework are:

Utilize data engineering skills to analyze HCHO data in Sri Lanka.
Understand the importance of HCHO monitoring for air quality and climate studies.
Develop insights into potential HCHO sources and spatial/temporal trends.
Develop time series prediction algorithms (such as ARIMA models) to forecast future HCHO levels.
Data Description
The dataset contains daily HCHO measurements from the Sentinel-5P satellite for seven cities in Sri Lanka: Colombo Proper, Deniyaya (Matara), Nuwara Eliya Proper, Bibile (Monaragala), Kurunegala Proper, Jaffna Proper, and Kandy Proper. The historical data spans from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2023. Each row of the dataset includes the HCHO reading, location, current date, and next date.

Tasks
Data Preprocessing
Clean and prepare the data by addressing missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
Explore descriptive statistics to summarize HCHO levels for each city and visualize data distribution using histograms, boxplots, or other visualizations.
Spatio-Temporal Analysis
Analyze trends over time, identify seasonal variations, and compare trends across cities.
Correlate HCHO levels with external factors such as weather, fire events, or anthropogenic activities.
Compare spatial patterns of HCHO distribution between cities and investigate potential contributing factors.
Machine Learning
Develop a machine learning model (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future HCHO levels based on historical data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
Conclusion
This coursework provides valuable insights into air quality and public health risks associated with HCHO pollution in Sri Lanka. By analyzing satellite data and implementing machine learning models, researchers can contribute to environmental research and promote sustainable development practices.
